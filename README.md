# Fireworks
Vulkan 2D Fireworks Animation

Goal is to animate 5-pointed star geometries shooting in random directions at different velocities, starting from the same (random) origin. This is repeated indefinitely.

The base code is adapted from the excellent (C++) Vulkan tutorial: https://vulkan-tutorial.com/
